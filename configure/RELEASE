# PCDS Note: Compiling with LINUX_GPIB=YES requires that the
# linux-gpib package be installed.  The most recent version
# compatible with our 2.6.18 kernel is linux-gpib-3.2.09
# This version is currently installed on:
#	psusr117.dev.pcdsn

# Define the version(s) of any other needed modules

# IPAC is only needed for Greensprings IP-488 driver 
#IPAC_MODULE_VERSION=R3.0.0-1.0.4
# SNCSEQ is only needed to build the asyn test app named testIPServerApp
#SNCSEQ_MODULE_VERSION=R2.1.10-0.1.0

# External Support module path definitions
#
# If any of these macros expand to a path which
# contains an "include" directory, that directory will be
# included in the compiler include path.
#
# If any of these macros expand to a path which
# contains a "lib/<arch>" directory, that directory will be
# included in the compiler link path for that architecture.
#
# If your build fails, look for these paths in your build output
